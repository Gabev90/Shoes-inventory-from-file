inventory

This code will read in an inventory.txt file and will store datas as objects from it. (based on OOP) This list will be used for the next things:

"read_shoes_data" This function will read in the txt file

"capture_shoes" This function will let the user to add a new product/object to the list or inventory (not to the .txt file, just to the list)

"view_all" print out all the objects on the list on a readable way.

"re_stock" print out the shoes which has the lowest stock number in the list. (and gives an option to add to the stock number)

"seach_shoe" print out the product based on the product code

"value_per_item" print out the stock value of the products on the list

"highest_qty" print out the product with the highest stock number

You can call these functions with the menu which is the part of the code.

Install: You have to open the inventory.py with a program which can run python codes.
